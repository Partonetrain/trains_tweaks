# Train's Tweaks
### *Tweaks you won't find anywhere else!**
<sup><sub>I make no guarantee these are exclusive to Train's Tweaks</sub></sup>

This mod is a compilation (and port to multi-platform) of several of my previous tweak mods, in addition to tweaks I've found myself wanting while making modpacks.
You can even request a tweak (assuming it isn't already possible with datapacks, commands, or other mods) on the GitHub.
With Train's Tweaks, you can make your game even more customizable and configurable.

|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CustomRarity | Allows the user to define rarity levels using item tags or item components.                  | Yes                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Experience   | Configure the experience/level curve. Many options are available.                            | No                  | This is a port of my LinearLevels mod and is incompatible with forks of it such as Fixed Levels. Also, XP storage mods will not use the correct numbers (unless they dynamically calculate a ratio of xp-to-level using Player#getXpNeededForNextLevel) |
| MobDrops     | Replace hardcoded mobs drops such as Nether Star and Chicken Egg with loot tables.           | No                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Ocelot       | Makes Ocelots tameable into cats again. Can be configured to produce a specific cat variant. | Yes                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
