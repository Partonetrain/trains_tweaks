# Train's Tweaks
### *Tweaks you won't find anywhere else!**
<sup><sub>*I make no guarantee any particular tweak is exclusive to Train's Tweaks</sub></sup>

Train's Tweaks allows users and modpack developers to overcome certain hardcoded aspects of Minecraft.
With Train's Tweaks, you can take your customization of Minecraft to the next level!

This mod is a compilation (and port to multi-platform) of several of my previous tweak mods, other tweaks I've found myself wanting while making modpacks, and user requests.
You can even request a tweak (assuming it isn't already possible with datapacks, commands, or other mods) on the GitHub, but I make no promises about my ability to implement it.

--todo: finish mob spawn equipment: piglin, zombie piglin, piglin brute, vex, vindicator, wither skeleton,  enderman?

|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cure          | Configure Zombie Villager curing. Add effects that count as Weakness to the config file, and use the item tag `trains_tweaks:curing_items` to change which item(s) start the curing process. Or use `trains_tweaks:instant_curing_items` (which has Enchanted Golden Apple in by default) for instant conversion.                                                        | Yes                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Difficulty    | Modify how difficulty works; Option to remove damage multiplier from difficulty setting and apply constant modifiers to regional difficulty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | No                       | Your configuration may have unintended consequences, especially with other mods who depend on these values. Use these config options sparingly                                                                                                                                    |
| Experience    | Configure the experience/level curve. Many options are available; choose from an increasing formula (Curve Mode) or a fixed amount of experience for each level. See [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1odNYoPElp61PSQIwmVLbh3zHttry5cQYojXIBB8U7w4/edit?usp=sharing) for comparisons.                                                           | No                       | This is a port of my LinearLevels mod and is incompatible with forks of it such as Fixed Levels. Also, XP storage mods will not use the correct numbers (unless they dynamically calculate a ratio of xp-to-level using `Player#getXpNeededForNextLevel`)                         |
| Loot          | Provides loot functions; currently only `trains_tweaks:enchant_treasure` and `trains_tweaks:enchant_curse` which both work like, and have the same options as, `minecraft:enchant_randomly` -- except it always provides a max level (non-curse) treasure enchantment (former) or curse (latter). Does absolutely nothing if you don't use these functions in a datapack | Yes (cannot be disabled) | Future versions of NeoForge might not like how these functions are registered but that shouldn't be too hard to fix                                                                                                                                                               |
| FireResistant | Allows the user to define which items have the fire-resistant property (or not) that Netherite items do using the item tags `trains_tweaks:fire_resistant` or `trains_tweaks:not_fire_resistant`.                                                                                                                                                                        | Yes                      | If Lychee is installed, `trains_tweaks:fire_immune` will not function. you should use the `lychee:fire_immune` item tag instead. `trains_tweaks:not_fire_immune` will still function in this case (assuming it's enabled in the config)                                           |
| MobDrops      | If enabled, replaces hardcoded mobs drops such as Nether Star, Chicken Egg, and Wither Rose with loot tables. See config file for loot table names. Also lets you enable baby drops.                                                                                                                                                                                     | No                       | Provided loot tables produce similar results to vanilla; you must make a datapack yourself to see changes.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| PowderWalking | Allows the user to define which items allow entities to walk on Powder Snow using the item tags `trains_tweaks:powder_walking_item` (for mainhand or offhand) or `trains_tweaks:powder_walking_armor` (for all armor slots).                                                                                                                                             | Yes                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Rarity        | Allows the user to define [rarity](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Rarity) for items using item tags (`trains_tweaks:common` to `trains_tweaks:epic`). Prevents enchantments from changing an item's rarity (can be disabled). Train's Tweaks also provides Item Modifiers so commands or loot tables can easily change the rarity of an individual item.                       | Yes                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| SpawnsWith    | Define what equipment mobs spawn with using the Equipment loot tables added in 1.21. This means you can disable zombies spawning with shovels, for instance. See below for more details. Note that this can cause issues (such as mobs not spawning) with misconfigured loot tables!                                                                                     | No* (Yes In Dev)         | Mods that inject into any particular mobs' populateDefaultEquipmentSlots method probably interferes with this; ideally, if you wanted to use this, you would disable other mods' equipment spawning feature and then add that mod's equipment to the Train's Tweaks loot table(s) |
| TameOcelot    | Makes Ocelots tameable into cats again. Can be configured to produce a specific cat variant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Yes                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Yeet          | Configs relating to throwing things; makes fire charges throwable, snowballs inflict freeze ticks, and Bottle O' Enchanting grant 10 xp by default                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Yes                      | The "Snowballs Freeze Mobs" mod does not actually inflict freeze ticks, only inflicting blindness, so it should be compatible                                                                                                                                                     |


### About the SpawnsWith feature

If the SpawnsWith feature and "Generic Mob Tables" option are enabled, mobs that are capable of spawning with armor (for example, zombies and skeletons) will instead roll the `trains_tweaks:equipment/generic` loot table.
From here, equipment that is rolled will be equipped on the mob. The loot table is rolled with the local difficulty where the mob is spawning as the luck value, making it possible for different rates on different difficulties (using "bonus_rolls" and "quality" fields).

Additionally, for specific vanilla mobs that can spawn with equipment (see table below), there are config options to use a loot table instead of the vanilla equipment-setting code. 
These loot tables can be found [here](https://github.com/Partonetrain/trains_tweaks/tree/1.21.1/common/src/main/resources/data/trains_tweaks/loot_table/equipment). These too are rolled with local difficulty passed as luck.
I tried to make the default ones 1:1 with vanilla, but due to loot tables inherently not being as flexible as code, it is recommended you only enable config options per mob that you intend to customize the equipment loot table of.

The drop chance of **all** items generated when any SpawnsWith equipment table is not defined in the table, but rather the config file.
The Carved Pumpkin/Jack-o-Lantern helmet spawns on Halloween cannot overwrite helmets equipped by equipment tables.
Enchantments can be defined in generic or specific loot tables, but the vanilla logic that uses the `minecraft:on_mob_spawn_equipment` enchantment tag still runs. This can be disabled by overriding and emptying said tag.
However, raid mobs have different hardcoded enchantment generation, which currently cannot be changed.
Mobs that pick up items will still drop picked up items 100% of the time.

#### Technical details
Mobs that roll `trains_tweaks:equipment/generic` are all mobs that call `super.populateDefaultEquipmentSlots` (or initEquipment in Yarn). This may or may not apply to modded mobs.
Halloween helmet spawns are unaffected because the date and no-helmet-equipped checks happen *after* populateDefaultEquipmentSlots. Drowned nautilus shell works the same way.

Unfortunately, there's no good way to programmatically apply this to any mob defined in datapack; mob-specific loot tables only work with mobs the mod is specifically programmed to effect.
However, it is possible for other mod developers to make their mobs' equipment customizable:
If *I* were making a mob that I wanted to have random equipment and I wanted that equipment to be customizable by the end-user, I would define it in a loot table of type `minecraft:equipment` and then use that in its populateDefaultEquipmentSlots/initEquipment method.
