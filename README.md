# Train's Tweaks
### *Tweaks you won't find anywhere else!**
<sup><sub>*I make no guarantee any particular tweak is exclusive to Train's Tweaks</sub></sup>

This mod is a compilation (and port to multi-platform) of several of my previous tweak mods, in addition to tweaks I've found myself wanting while making modpacks.
You can even request a tweak (assuming it isn't already possible with datapacks, commands, or other mods) on the GitHub.
With Train's Tweaks, you can take your customization of Minecraft to the next level!

| Experience | Configure the experience/level curve. Many options are available; choose from an increasing formula (Curve Mode) or a fixed amount of experience for each level. See [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1odNYoPElp61PSQIwmVLbh3zHttry5cQYojXIBB8U7w4/edit?usp=sharing) for comparisons. | No                  | This is a port of my LinearLevels mod and is incompatible with forks of it such as Fixed Levels. Also, XP storage mods will not use the correct numbers (unless they dynamically calculate a ratio of xp-to-level using Player#getXpNeededForNextLevel) |
| MobDrops   | Replace hardcoded mobs drops such as Nether Star, Chicken Egg, and Fox Spawning with loot tables. Also lets you enable baby drops.                                                                                                                                                                             | No                  | Provided loot tables produce identical results to vanilla; you must make a datapack yourself to see changes.                                                                                                                                            |
| Rarity     | Allows the user to define rarity levels using item tags. Prevents enchantments from changing an item's rarity (can be disabled). Train's Tweaks also provides Item Modifiers so commands or loot tables can easily change the rarity of an individual item.                                                    | Yes                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| TameOcelot | Makes Ocelots tameable into cats again. Can be configured to produce a specific cat variant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Yes                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
