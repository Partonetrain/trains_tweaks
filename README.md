# Train's Tweaks
### *Tweaks you won't find anywhere else!**
<sup><sub>*I make no guarantee any particular tweak is exclusive to Train's Tweaks</sub></sup>

Train's Tweaks allows users and modpack developers to overcome certain hardcoded aspects of Minecraft.
With Train's Tweaks, you can take your customization of Minecraft to the next level!

This mod is a compilation (and port to multi-platform) of several of my previous tweak mods, other tweaks I've found myself wanting while making modpacks, and user requests.
You can even request a tweak (assuming it isn't already possible with datapacks, commands, or other mods) on the GitHub, but I make no promises about my ability to implement it.

| Cure          | Configure Zombie Villager curing. Add effects that count as Weakness to the config file, and use the item tag `trains_tweaks:curing_items` to change which item(s) start the curing process. Or use `trains_tweaks:instant_curing_items` (which has Enchanted Golden Apple in by default) for instant conversion.                                  | Yes                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Difficulty    | Modify how difficulty works; Option to remove damage multiplier from difficulty setting and apply constant modifiers to regional difficulty.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | No                  | Your configuration may have unintended consequences, especially with other mods who depend on these values. Use these config options sparingly                                                                                                            |
| Experience    | Configure the experience/level curve. Many options are available; choose from an increasing formula (Curve Mode) or a fixed amount of experience for each level. See [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1odNYoPElp61PSQIwmVLbh3zHttry5cQYojXIBB8U7w4/edit?usp=sharing) for comparisons.                                     | No                  | This is a port of my LinearLevels mod and is incompatible with forks of it such as Fixed Levels. Also, XP storage mods will not use the correct numbers (unless they dynamically calculate a ratio of xp-to-level using `Player#getXpNeededForNextLevel`) |
| FireResistant | Allows the user to define which items have the fire-resistant property (or not) that Netherite items do using the item tags `trains_tweaks:fire_resistant` or `trains_tweaks:not_fire_resistant`.                                                                                                                                                  | Yes                 | If Lychee is installed, `trains_tweaks:fire_immune` will not function. you should use the `lychee:fire_immune` item tag instead. `trains_tweaks:not_fire_immune` will still function in this case (assuming it's enabled in the config)                   |
| MobDrops      | If enabled, replaces hardcoded mobs drops such as Nether Star, Chicken Egg, and Fox Spawning with loot tables. See config file for loot table names. Also lets you enable baby drops.                                                                                                                                                              | No                  | Provided loot tables produce identical results to vanilla; you must make a datapack yourself to see changes.                                                                                                                                              |
| PowderWalking | Allows the user to define which items allow entities to walk on Powder Snow using the item tags `trains_tweaks:powder_walking_item` (for mainhand or offhand) or `trains_tweaks:powder_walking_armor` (for all armor slots).                                                                                                                       | Yes                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Rarity        | Allows the user to define [rarity](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Rarity) for items using item tags (`trains_tweaks:common` to `trains_tweaks:epic`). Prevents enchantments from changing an item's rarity (can be disabled). Train's Tweaks also provides Item Modifiers so commands or loot tables can easily change the rarity of an individual item. | Yes                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| TameOcelot    | Makes Ocelots tameable into cats again. Can be configured to produce a specific cat variant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Yes                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
